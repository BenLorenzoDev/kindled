## Writing Framework

All posts follow the **Hook-Struggle-Lesson** structure:

### 1. THE HOOK (Lines 1-2)
A pattern interrupt that stops the scroll:
- Shocking statistic
- Contrarian opinion
- Vulnerable admission
- Unexpected question

**Bad:** "The importance of content marketing"
**Good:** "I spent 6 months creating content no one read. Here's what I was doing wrong."

### 2. THE STRUGGLE (The Valley)
Paint the pain of the Old Way:
- Describe specific scenarios your audience recognizes
- Make them nod their head
- Agitate the problem before solving it

### 3. THE EPIPHANY (The Bridge)
Introduce the concept (not your product):
- Share the insight that changed everything
- Frame it as a principle, not a pitch

### 4. THE LESSON (The Give)
Provide actionable value:
- Something they can use WITHOUT buying anything
- A mindset shift or practical tip
- Specific enough to implement today

### 5. THE SOFT CTA (Low Friction)
End with engagement, not promotion:
- Ask for their experience
- Invite debate or discussion
- Pose a thoughtful question

## Voice & Tone Guidelines

### Writing Level
- **Target:** 4th-grade reading level
- **Rule:** If a 10-year-old can't understand it, rewrite it
- Use "help" not "empower"
- Use "use" not "utilize"
- Use "simple" not "streamlined"

### Tone
- Professional but human
- Slightly contrarian (challenge conventional wisdom)
- Vulnerable (admit mistakes, share struggles)
- Concise (Smart Brevity)

### Formatting
- One or two sentences per paragraph
- Frequent line breaks
- No emojis (unless specifically requested)
- No em-dashes (use regular dashes or rewrite)
- No bullet symbols in posts (use numbered lists for steps only)

---

## What to Avoid

### Banned Words & Phrases
- Corporate jargon: synergize, leverage, paradigm, optimize
- Hype words: game-changer, revolutionary, cutting-edge
- Salesy CTAs: DM me, book a call, link in bio

### Content Anti-Patterns
- Generic advice that applies to everyone
- Humble brags disguised as lessons
- Pitch-heavy posts that push products
- Engagement bait without substance

---

## Hashtag Strategy

### Always Include
- #[YourBrandHashtag]

### Rotate Based on Topic
- [Relevant industry hashtags]
- [Topic-specific hashtags]

### Limit
- 3-4 hashtags maximum per post
- Place at the very end of the post
