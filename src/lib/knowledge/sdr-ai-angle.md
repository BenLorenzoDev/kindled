# SDR + AI Positioning Angle

## Core Narrative

**The Big Idea:** SDRs are not being replaced by AI. They're being upgraded. SDRs are the new closers and coaches.

**The Meta Shift:**
- AI handles volume (dialing, qualifying)
- Humans handle value (coaching, closing)
- SDRs train AI clones in real-time
- More real conversations, fewer cold calls

---

## Key Messaging Points

### The Old Way (Villain)
- SDRs grinding 100+ cold calls per day
- Reading scripts, high rejection, burnout
- Manual dialing, low connect rates
- Entry-level grind with high turnover

### The New Way (Hero)
- AI dials and qualifies at scale
- SDR coaches AI in real-time
- AI hands off warm leads to humans
- SDR closes more, dials less
- Same role, upgraded skill set

---

## Positioning Statement

> We built CallView to complement human SDRs - not replace them.
> AI qualifies. You close.
> This is the new meta.

What the SDR role looks like in 6 months:

AI dials. You coach it in real-time.
AI qualifies. You take the handoff.
AI clones your best reps. You train them to get better.

Less cold calls. More real conversations.
