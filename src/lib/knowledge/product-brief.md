## Part 5: Core Philosophy

### The Anti-Pitch Approach

- **Old Way:** [What your audience is currently doing that doesn't work]
- **New Way:** [The better approach you advocate]

### Key Messaging Principles

1. **Sell the philosophy, not the product** - Change beliefs before behavior
2. **Vulnerability over polish** - Admitting mistakes builds trust

4. **Questions over pitches** - Invite conversation, don't push sales

### What We Never Do

- Pitch products directly in content
- Use corporate jargon
- Write generic motivational fluff
- Sound like marketing copy
- End with "DM me" or "Book a call"
